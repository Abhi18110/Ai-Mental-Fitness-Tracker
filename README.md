# Ai-Mental-Fitness-Tracker

**Project Title: Mental Fitness Prediction**

## Overview

This project aims to predict mental fitness levels using machine learning techniques. It analyzes the prevalence of mental and substance use disorders across different countries and years to develop accurate predictive models. The project provides valuable insights into mental health trends and aids mental health professionals, policymakers, and researchers in making informed decisions.

## Project Overview

Mental fitness is a critical aspect of overall well-being. This project explores the correlation between mental and substance use disorders, enabling the creation of models to predict mental fitness levels based on historical data. The project aims to provide accurate predictions and valuable insights to support decision-making in the mental health domain.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mental-fitness-prediction.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd mental-fitness-prediction
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python and the required dependencies installed (see Installation section).
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing the project code.
3. Run the code cells or execute the script to analyze the data, build the models, and make predictions.
4. View the results and insights generated by the project.

## Data

The project utilizes two datasets:

1. `prevalence-by-mental-and-substance-use-disorder.csv`: Contains information on the prevalence of mental and substance use disorders in different countries and years.
2. `mental-and-substance-use-as-share-of-disease.csv`: Provides data on the share of mental and substance use disorders in the overall disease burden.

Both datasets are merged to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis and model building.

## Models

The project employs two machine learning models:

1. Linear Regression: Used for initial predictions of mental fitness levels based on the available features.
2. Random Forest Regression: Employed to enhance prediction accuracy and capture complex relationships in the data.

The models are trained on the dataset and evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2).
